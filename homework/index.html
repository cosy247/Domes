                    <b>List one: Some scientists believe it is very soon that computers will be more intelligent than human. Some people think it is a positive development, while others think it is a negative development. Discuss both views and give your opinion.</b>
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    In 2016, the AI machine AlphaGoâ€™s triumph over the chess champions has laid bare a breathtaking / appalling trend that computers could outsmart human beings. Calamitous scenes in sci-fi movies pop up in our mind that the world is dominated by machines and people are entangled in the nuclear war staged by computers. But what would really come out of increasingly smarter computers is a question that we should answer based on the reality. Computer technology has arguably transformed our life for better. Countless projects and tasks are made possible and successfully conducted, which are otherwise unimaginable without the involvement of high-speed calculation of computer and intricate algorithm. Last century, it took hundreds of thousands of people several years to fulfil the moon landing project of Apollo, allegedly consuming papers piled up higher than many skyscrapers combined. Today, a private company SpaceX has successfully launched many cheaper and reusable
                    rockets and embarks on the task of landing on Mars. This is a company with no more than a thousand staff, a streamlined team only possible for the involvement of modern computer technology.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Autopilot car is a second example. Cars equipped with smart computer system will know when to tread on brakes and how to avoid obstacles. Ideally, you just need to tell the destination to the car and it will take you there without any human intervention. Smart machines will be used in almost every field to promote working efficiency and liberate us from fatiguing work. As a further example, in the future computer will replace interpreters in the field of translation and international conference with more precise and quicker language exchange.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Perks and curses come side by side. The apocalyptical scenes envisioned in sci-fi movies are not necessarily groundless. It is not that computers will enslave we human beings and launch nuclear war, but that whether those in charge of technologies would use them ethically and constructively or not. Computer itself is blameless unless we human beings use it wrongly.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Thus, a palpable trend is that computers will further revolutionize our life. We are optimistic about a bright future fueled by the technology. But we also should bear in mind that precautions and regulations should be orchestrated lest computer technologies be taken advantage of by treacherous individuals or groups.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    a.This question has certain reliability and credibility. At present, computers have outperformed human beings in some aspects, such as chess, playing games and so on. However, computers still have many limitations, such as lack of creativity, emotional and moral judgment. At the same time, computers may be used by criminals. Therefore, whether computers will be more intelligent than humans, and to what extent, still need to be further studied and discussed.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    b.This article reports on the question of whether computers will be more intelligent than humans, and the discussion and impact of this idea.
